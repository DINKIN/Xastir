echo Please note that a subdirectory called "Xastir" will be created

echo already have an "Xastir" directory and are running the script
echo from there, you may want to run it from one directory higher up
echo instead.  Just stop this script and run these commands instead:
echo
echo "    cd .."
echo "    ./xastir/install-xastir"
echo
echo Press ENTER to continue downloading the latest Xastir sources:

# Fetch the latest Xastir sources

echo If you have previously set up the /etc/sudoers file as described in README.GIT,
echo you should have "xastir" and "callpass" binaries installed in /usr/local/bin.
echo If not, set up the /etc/sudoers file now and run the "update-xastir" command
echo listed below.  To update Xastir to the latest version at any time in the future,
echo change to the "Xastir" directory and type:
echo
echo "    ./update-xastir"

echo Running Xastir:  Execute this command to get your passcode.  You will need the
echo number it computes in order to authenticate with the internet servers.  The
echo number is entered in the "passcode" box when setting up an internet server
echo interface:
echo
echo "    callpass"
echo
echo Start Xastir itself by typing:
